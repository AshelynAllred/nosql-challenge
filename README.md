# nosql-challenge
data analytics bootcamp challenge using MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on documents in a collection.

## Where to find stuff
All of the Jupyter notebooks are in the root directory of the repo. The source used for the MongoDB collection is available in the `/Resources` folder

## Credit
I spoke with fellow student Jody Larson for her method on finding documents within 0.01 degrees of latitude/longitude. It turns out I was heavily overcomplicating things, trying to sort locations by distance from Penang Flavours as well as by Hygiene which was unnecessary. The rest of the work was relatively trivial and did not require much research or references aside from my personal notes.

The remainder of work is my own, aside from that which is prefilled by the starter code (python imports, basic MongoClient setup, etc.)
